 <p> Gentlemen of the Congress: Once more, as repeatedly before, the spokesmen of 
     the Central Empires have indicated their desire to discuss the objects of war and the 
     possible basis of a general peace. Parleys have been in progress at Brest-Litovsk between 
     Russian representatives and representatives of the Central Powers to which the attention 
     of all the belligerents has been invited for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may 
     be possible to extend these parleys into a general conference with regard to terms of 
     peace	and	settlement.	The	Russian	representatives	presented	not	only	a	perfectly	definite statement of the principles upon which they would be willing to conclude peace, but 
     also	an	equally	definite	program	of	the	concrete	application	of	those	principles.	The	
     representatives of the Central Powers, on their part, presented an outline of settlement 
     which,	if	much	less	definite,	seemed	susceptible	of	liberal	interpretation	until	their	
     specific	program	of	practical	terms	was	added.	That	program	proposed	no	concessions	at	
     all, either to the sovereignty of Russia or to the preferences of the populations with 
     whose fortunes it dealt, but meant, in a word, that the Central Empires were to keep 
     every foot of territory their armed forces had occupied every province, every city, every 
     point of vantage as a permanent addition to their territories and their power.
